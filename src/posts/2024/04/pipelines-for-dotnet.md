Learn how to make a pipeline for your .NET program or library, with GitHub Actions examples.<!-- excerpt -->

## *Pipelines*

Pipelines are sequences of commands that are executed to ensure the integrity of the code and to produce a final artifact, such as an executable program or a library.

Having a pipeline means having a consistent process that mitigates the risk of human errors in the final product, and also saves the programmer's time, because he/she can take care of other tasks while the code is compiled, verified and packed.

## Steps

flowchart TD
    checkout -->
    clean --> 
    restore -->
    audit -->
    sbom -->
    build -->
    unittests[unit tests]
    unittests --if program--> publish --with docker--> dockerk8s[docker / kubernetes]
    publish --no docker--> zipinstaller[zip / installer]
    unittests --if nuget package--> pack --> nugetpush[nuget push]
```

### checkout

Fetches the code from the Git branch. If it's a (integration) CI process, the branch is the one that intends to be merged; if it's a CD (deployment), the code is from the release branch, such as *develop*, *master* or *release_candidate*.

Command line: `git clone`

### clean

Cleans the *bin* and *obj* folders, to guarantee that everything will start from zero, with no interferences from previous compilations.

Command line: `dotnet clean`

### restore

Guarantees that the references between projects in the solution are correct and downloads the required NuGet packages.

Command line: `dotnet restore`

### audit

Verifies if there are any NuGet packages in the project with security problems, checking in the [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/) (*Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures*) and [GHSA](https://github.com/advisories) (*GitHub Advisory Database*) lists.

Command line: `dotnet list package --vulnerable --include-transitive`

### sbom

SBOM, *software bill of materials*, is a document that informs which components were used to produce a program or a library.

This document is of utmost importance for critical software, because with it, organizations can easily know which of its applications are in danger when a vulnerability in a library is reported. After the [2020 cyberattack on the USA government](https://www.eetimes.com/solarwinds-fallout-are-sboms-the-answer/), SBOMs became endorsed by the White House.

I recommend the [CycloneDX](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-dotnet) format, for being more succinct and easier to read.

Command line:

* In CycloneDX format: `dotnet CycloneDX`
* In SPDX format: `sbom-tool generate`

### build

Compiles the solution code.

Command line: `dotnet build`

### unit tests

Runs the solution's unit tests to ensure that they are passing.

In this step, we can produce a report that shows the coverage level of the unit tests against the code, revealing which classes, methods and lines were covered by the tests. [ReportGenerator](https://reportgenerator.io) is the main tool for these reports in .NET projects.

Command line:

* Unit tests: `dotnet test`
* Coverage report: `reportgenerator`

### publish

Generates the final program for execution. This step differs from build because here certain compilation options can be specified, like the target runtime, self-contained, single-file, and others.

Command line: `dotnet publish`

### pack

Makes a NuGet package, in case of a code that is meant to be a library.

Command line: `dotnet pack`

### nuget push

Upload a package to a NuGet server, private or public, so it can be used by other people.

Command line: `dotnet nuget push`

## Pipeline engines

There are many pipeline engines available, such as GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Azure Pipelines, CircleCI and many others.

You can also have your pipeline as a script, to run locally in your machine. This is a good practice for being a safeguard when your remote pipeline is unavailable or offline, and you can test modifications before commiting them into the remote pipeline.

I personally recommend using [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) scripts for local pipelines, because it's a multiplatform and friendly language, with easy interaction with XML and JSON. Nevertheless, you can use other scripting languages, like Batch, Shell, Python and others you like.
